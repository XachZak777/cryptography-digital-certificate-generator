# No external dependencies required!
# All cryptographic operations are implemented from scratch.
# 
# This project uses only Python standard library:
# - socket (network communication)
# - json (message serialization)
# - base64 (encoding)
# - os (random number generation, file operations)
# - hashlib (SHA-256 for certificate signing)
# - datetime (certificate validity periods)
# - typing (type hints)
# - random (prime number generation)
